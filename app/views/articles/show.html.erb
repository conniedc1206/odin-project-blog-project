<%# We can now update an article by visiting its edit page, e.g. http://localhost:3000/articles/1/edit. To finish up, let's link to the edit page from the bottom of app/views/articles/show.html.erb: %>
<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %></li>
</ul>

<%# Now let's add a link at the bottom of app/views/articles/show.html.erb so that we can delete an article from its own page: %>
<%# In the above code, we use the data option to set the data-turbo-method and data-turbo-confirm HTML attributes of the "Destroy" link. Both of these attributes hook into Turbo, which is included by default in fresh Rails applications. data-turbo-method="delete" will cause the link to make a DELETE request instead of a GET request. data-turbo-confirm="Are you sure?" will cause a confirmation dialog to appear when the link is clicked. If the user cancels the dialog, the request will be aborted. %>
<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %></li>
  <li><%= link_to "Destroy", article_path(@article), data: {
