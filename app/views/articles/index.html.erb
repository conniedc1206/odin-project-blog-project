<h1>Articles</h1>

<ul>
    <% @articles.each do |article| %>
        <li>
            <%= article.title %>
        </li>
    <% end %>
</ul>

<%# The browser makes a request: GET http://localhost:3000.
Our Rails application receives this request.
The Rails router maps the root route to the index action of ArticlesController.
The index action uses the Article model to fetch all articles in the database.
Rails automatically renders the app/views/articles/index.html.erb view.
The ERB code in the view is evaluated to output HTML.
The server sends a response containing the HTML back to the browser. %>
