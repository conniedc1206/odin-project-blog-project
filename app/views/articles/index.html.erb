        <%# The link_to helper renders a link with its first argument as the link's text and its second argument as the link's destination. If we pass a model object as the second argument, link_to will call the appropriate path helper to convert the object to a path.   %>

<%# The browser makes a request: GET http://localhost:3000.
Our Rails application receives this request.
The Rails router maps the root route to the index action of ArticlesController.
The index action uses the Article model to fetch all articles in the database.
Rails automatically renders the app/views/articles/index.html.erb view.
The ERB code in the view is evaluated to output HTML.
The server sends a response containing the HTML back to the browser. %>
